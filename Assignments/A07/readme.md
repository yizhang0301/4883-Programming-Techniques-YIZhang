## 11080 Place the Guards
In the country of Ajabdesh there are some streets and junctions.
Each street connects 2 junctions. The king of Ajabdesh wants to
place some guards in some junctions so that all the junctions and
streets can be guarded by them. A guard in a junction can guard
all the junctions and streets adjacent to it. But the guards themselves are not gentle. If a street is guarded by multiple guards
then they start fighting. So the king does not want the scenario
where a street may be guarded by two guards. Given the information about the streets and junctions of Ajabdesh, help the king
to find the minimum number of guards needed to guard all the
junctions and streets of his country
