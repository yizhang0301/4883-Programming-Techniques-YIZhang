## 108 Maximum Sum
A problem that is simple to solve in one dimension is often much more difficult to solve in more than
one dimension. Consider satisfying a boolean expression in conjunctive normal form in which each
conjunct consists of exactly 3 disjuncts. This problem (3-SAT) is NP-complete. The problem 2-SAT
is solved quite efficiently, however. In contrast, some problems belong to the same complexity class
regardless of the dimensionality of the problem.
Given a 2-dimensional array of positive and negative integers, find the sub-rectangle with the largest
sum. The sum of a rectangle is the sum of all the elements in that rectangle. In this problem the subrectangle with the largest sum is referred to as the maximal sub-rectangle.
A sub-rectangle is any contiguous sub-array of size 1 × 1 or greater located within the whole array.
As an example, the maximal sub-rectangle of the array:
0 −2 −7 0
9 2 −6 2 −4 1 −4 1 −1 8 0 −2
is in the lower-left-hand corner:
9 2
−4 1 −1 8
and has the sum of 15.
## Input
The input consists of an N × N array of integers.
The input begins with a single positive integer N on a line by itself indicating the size of the square
two dimensional array. This is followed by N2
integers separated by white-space (newlines and spaces).
These N2
integers make up the array in row-major order (i.e., all numbers on the first row, left-to-right,
then all numbers on the second row, left-to-right, etc.). N may be as large as 100. The numbers in the
array will be in the range [−127, 127].
## Output
The output is the sum of the maximal sub-rectangle.
